# Dice-Pig-Game

Dice Pig is a fun and interactive two-player dice game where players take turns rolling a six-sided die to accumulate points. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach a predefined score threshold, typically 20 points.

Each turn, a player rolls the die. If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose all points accumulated during that turn. If they roll any other number, that number is added to their current score, and they can choose to either roll again or hold onto their current score and pass the turn to their opponent.

The twist in Dice Pig comes with the risk-reward strategy. Players must decide whether to continue rolling to accumulate more points or to play it safe and secure their current score to avoid losing it if they roll a 1.

The game continues until one player reaches or exceeds the winning score threshold, at which point they are declared the winner.

Dice Pig is a simple yet addictive game that combines luck with strategic decision-making, making it perfect for friendly competitions and family game nights.
